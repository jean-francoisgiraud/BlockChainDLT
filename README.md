This is a simple illustration of how blockchain technology [1] works. It is based on SHA256 [2] hashing to ensure data integrity by preventing tampering of past operations (any changes to any cell). Cells are hashed and each new block transaction integrates the hash of the previous transaction. This creates a connected chain of hashes. Any changes to previous data will break the chain at the point where the unauthorised change has been made and signal a loss of data integrity.  
[1] Used in for example: Crypto currencies (Bitcoin); smart contracts (counterfeit prevention, provenance, traceability, web of trusts, etc); certification, regulatory compliance, auditing.  
[2] SHA256 is an algorithm used to map data of any size to a fixed length. It was developed and approved by the NSA for use by the US Government and military.
